### Change Log

* See Change Log

### Possible Improvements
* Implement different color schemas
* Currently you can only select a single day, I could imagine that it would be helpful to select also weeks and months
* Display a color-legend


### License

The software is made available "AS IS" without any warranty of any kind under the MIT License (MIT).
Since this is a private project QlikTech support agreement does not cover support for this software.
